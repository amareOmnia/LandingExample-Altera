# LandingExample - Altera Services
Cooper's attempt at Altera site (very first html page from scratch).
Uses gulp, MAMP, and SASS for compiling. Fully responsive to mobile & desktop sizes. Includes a homemade JavaScript slider.

# Local Setup

To run this site locally, MAMP Pro is needed, as well as gulp:
- Direct terminal to site directory, then install dependencies: `npm install`
- Have a local server enabled in MAMP, with domain http://altera.local:8888
- Run the gulp BrowserSync with the command `gulp`
